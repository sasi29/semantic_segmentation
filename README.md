# semantic_segmentation
Segmentation is the process of slicing any digital image into various pixels. Thus one set of similar pixels will come under the same category. The pixels with the same label fall under the same category and share similar characteristics. The segmented regions will follow a meaningful shape and will indicate any particular object in the image such as human, tree, animal, etc. Thus in segmentation any image will be broken down into sets of pixels.
This adds more meaning to image pixels. When an input image is fed, there is extraction of objects done for segmentation. Segmentation is used to locate the contours and edges as well as the objects in the digital image. Segmentation is done to convert a low level image into a high level one. The colour image is converted to a binary image. Thus segmentation is useful in various image processing techniques. Segmentation can be carried out by different methods.
